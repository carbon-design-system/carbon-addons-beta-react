# carbon-addons-beta-react

Beta React components. Major versions may occur more rapidly here than in the main React library.

```
npm install -S carbon-addons-beta-react
```

Make sure in to include the Sass files in your own build - currently the Sass files require that you have an includePaths configuration in your Sass build to include the node_modules folder (which makes 'carbon-components/scss/....' resolve appropriately)
